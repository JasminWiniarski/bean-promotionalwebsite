    <h2>Interviews</h2>
    <h3>Mark & Bridie from Established</h3>
    <blockquote>Mark and Bridie opened Established together back in December 2013, in Cathedral Quarter Belfast. The premise for opening the coffee shop was around feeling that there wasn’t any really great specialty coffee focused cafés in Belfast.
    Having a passion for coffee, customer service and food, and being stuck with the idea for a while, they decided it was time to open the coffee shop that they felt they needed themselves.

    <h2>About the Bean App</h2>
    <img src="images/logogif">
    <p>The goal of this app is to show people that there’s more to coffee than just caffeine and maybe inspire them to explore a bit more and find a coffee type that they actually enjoy. We want for them to fall in  love with coffee just like we did! So no matter where you are on your coffee journey, get exploring.</p>
