    <h1>Established</h1>
<h2>With Mark Ashbridge and Bridie (Bridgeen) Barbour</h2>
<p>Mark and Bridie opened Established together back in December 2013, in Cathedral Quarter Belfast. The premise for opening the coffee shop was around feeling that there wasn’t any really great specialty coffee focused cafés in Belfast. Having a <b>passion for coffee, customer service and food</b>, and being stuck with the idea for a while, they decided it was time to open the coffee shop that they felt they needed themselves.</p>

    <p><i>Did you learn the craft before you opened the coffee shop or as you went along?</i></p>
    
    <p>A little bit of both. They brew coffee at home, and they met back in 2004 when they were both working in Starbucks. They’ve worked separate jobs after that, but working in a coffee shop gave them some training around being aware of coffee origins and the service aspect with putting systems and processes in place. </p>
    
    <blockquote>“Ultimately you always just pushed a button and got a coffee.”
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>Mark had a passion for what was happening beyond just pressing the button.</p>
    
    <p>Brewing coffee at home was the main learning curve over the next few years. This included watching videos, reading blogs and visiting forums where people were just <b>nerding-out about coffee</b>.</p>
    
    <p>At the end of 2012 it was decided: the goal was to actually open this café next year.</p>
    
    <p>This led Mark to put himself in the Irish Barista Competition back in December 2012. As he was working an office job at the time, he didn’t have the hands on experience with an espresso machine as he never had one at home.</p>
    
    <blockquote>“I need something to drive me to learn or even to make me learn and that seemed like a good way to do it.”</blockquote>
    
    <p>He watched a few Barista competitions online, then just threw himself straight into it. He started phoning friends who had cafés and just reached out to people in general asking if he could use their coffee machine for an afternoon or after they closed just to get a bit of practice.</p>
    
    <p>He finished 4th in the Irish Barista Championship in 2013.</p>
    
    <p>That gave him a little foot in the door in the coffee competitions world. He then won the Irish Aero Press Championship a few months later. He then went on to Melbourne to the world Aero Press Championship that year and he finished 4th.</p>
    
    
    <p>It was an unorthodox way of learning, but that way he got to meet people from all over the place. <i>Coffee Angel, Roasted Browne</i> and <i>3fe</i> to name a few. That’s where he also got to work for a few hours. <b>The big problem at the time was that there were no places like this in Belfast.</b></p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <p><i>What does your perfect cup of coffee look like?</i></p>
    
    <blockquote>“Black and well extracted.
        <br>
    
    There’s so much that has to come together to make a great cup of coffee that it’s hard to put it into one thing.”</blockquote>
    
    <p>He’s not a big fan of flat whites, as it’s not what he was brought up with at home. Coffee for him is what his parents introduced him to at home. Always filtered, freshly ground coffee, hot water,  freshly brewed. Understanding roast levels. Well roasted coffee, then well brewed.</p>
    
    <blockquote>“Filtered coffee is kind of my big thing, and I’m often dissatisfied with coffees that I make and we make at home”.</blockquote>
    
    <hr>
    
    <p><i>There was always this social aspect to coffee, do you see this going away, now that people work on their laptops from coffee shops?</i></p>
    
    <p>This is the part where Bridie joins the conversation.</p>
    
    <blockquote>“It’s a bit of everything and that’s what we’re trying to provide, always trying to have that little bit of everything.”</blockquote>
    
    <p>Especially with Belfast being so small, you can’t really target just one specific customer type. Working in their own café they noticed how diverse their client base is, both age and career wise.</p>
    
    <p>At the very start it’s a battle, you want as many people to come in as possible and if the café is empty that’s a huge barrier for the customer. From the business point of view you want a diverse base of customers, that’s the whole point of coffee. You come in for a cup and might end up having a conversation with a total stranger. It’s the service element, both of them assure me that they are chatter boxes and are very happy to do that.</p>
    
    <blockquote>“The café feels at it’s best when everyone chips in, customers and staff.”</blockquote>
    
    <p>They’ve been really lucky to see little families grow, you start with a woman coming in for a cappuccino every day and then she orders a decaf for the next few days, children that’ve grown up there.</p>
    
    <blockquote>“We have so many loyal customers from all different types of backgrounds, and that’s something we never want to lose, it’s what created the environment in there.
        <br>
   What we do is serving great coffee, with great food and we do it with great service, who does that not appeal to?”</blockquote>
    
    <p>They worked really hard from the service perspective to make sure that people were comfortable, wether they know much about coffee or not. The staff is ready to start a conversation with you if you want to find out more about coffee, but they are not patronising you. But no matter what, the customer will get good coffee.</p>
    
    <p>Mark and Bridie spend a lot of time in coffee shops themselves, especially when they travel.</p>
    
    <blockquote>“It’s the first place you go to, you try to find a coffee shop.”</blockquote>
    
    <p>When people say they love coffee, everyone has their own little routine, their own idea of what coffee is, whether that’s someone who puts two teaspoons of instant coffee instead of one, or orders a venti white chocolate Mocha with cream, or Kebele Konga from Ethiopia brewed in a v60. Those are 3 different things, but they’re all coffee. And you can’t say to someone that no they don’t really love coffee because they put too much sugar in theirs or because they don’t drink it black.</p>
    
    <p>A lot of their customers drink black americanos in the morning, because that bitter taste is what their association is in the morning time before they go into work. And established totally appreciates that that’s what you want to drink. They understand people’s preferences and their little morning routines.</p>
    
    <p>Their own routine in the morning is to drink black filtered coffee. Looking at other people’s habits and understanding them, like some people want to talk in the morning, others don’t and you some people don’t want to to look at them in the eye. And that’s the service they want to provide, looking at people individually and how they drink their coffee, they’re just happy that they picked them and put that trust into them that they’re getting the coffee they want to drink with a good service along the way.</p>
    
    <p>It was a bit of a shock to people when they first opened, especially since there used to be another coffee shop down the street that was charging 90p for a coffee. People started coming in out of curiosity for a cup or two.</p>
    
    
    <blockquote>“And amazingly after they drank coffee with us 2 or 3 times, when they back to the other place and you see them walk past with a cup from there, but then they’ll come back in and you joke that you saw them with the other cup and they say ‘I can’t drink that anymore, like you’ve ruined me.’” </blockquote>
    
    <p>That became their little thing that they want to ruin people from bad coffee. They don’t judge people for what they drink but you can’t go backwards. When you’re used to drinking 3£ wine and then you go out and buy a £20 one it’s over.</p>
    
    <p>It’s one of those things with coffee, you can’t go backwards.</p>
